## Overview

The GitHub Issues integration brings AI-powered investigation and autonomous development directly to your GitHub issues. Think of it as having a team of senior developers analyze your issues, find root causes, and prepare implementation plans—all automatically.

### What Can It Do?

- **Import issues** from any GitHub repository
- **Run AI investigations** with 4 parallel specialist agents
- **Create Auto Claude tasks** directly from investigation results
- **Post findings** back to GitHub as comments
- **Track progress** from issue to completed work

### Why Use It?

Traditional issue handling involves manual investigation, debugging, and planning. Auto Claude's GitHub Issues integration automates this:

- **Save time:** AI investigates while you focus on other work
- **Deeper insights:** 4 specialists analyze in parallel (root cause, impact, fixes, reproducibility)
- **Seamless workflow:** Go from GitHub issue to implemented feature without leaving Auto Claude
- **Consistent quality:** Every investigation follows the same thorough process

## FAQ

### General

**Q: Do I need a GitHub account?**
A: Yes, you need a GitHub account with access to the repositories you want to investigate.

**Q: Does this work with private repositories?**
A: Yes, as long as your GitHub account has access to the private repository.

**Q: Can I investigate issues from any repository?**
A: Yes, any repository you have access to—your own repos, organization repos, or public repos.

### Investigation

**Q: How long does an investigation take?**
A: Typically 2-5 minutes for standard mode, 1-2 minutes with Fast Mode enabled. Complex issues may take longer.

**Q: What if the investigation doesn't find a root cause?**
A: The specialists report their confidence levels. Low confidence means more context is needed—try again after providing more information or reproduction steps.

**Q: Can I run multiple investigations at once?**
A: Yes, you can investigate multiple issues simultaneously. Each investigation runs independently with its own specialists.

**Q: Do investigations use my API quota?**
A: GitHub API calls are minimal (fetching issues). The heavy lifting is done by Auto Claude's AI agents, which use your Claude API subscription or configured profiles.

### Tasks & Implementation

**Q: Do I have to create a task after investigating?**
A: No, you can investigate just to understand the issue. Task creation is optional.

**Q: Can I edit the task before starting the build?**
A: Yes, the task is fully editable. You can modify the description, add requirements, or adjust the scope.

**Q: What happens to the task after implementation?**
A: The task goes through QA validation, then you review the changes before merging to your main branch.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: "Failed to fetch issues" error**
A: Check that:
- GitHub CLI is authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- Your repository URL is correct
- You have access to the repository

**Q: Investigation stuck at "Starting..."**
A: This usually means:
- Claude API is unreachable (check your connection)
- Rate limit hit (Auto Claude switches accounts automatically)
- Check Settings → Claude Profiles for account status

**Q: Results seem inaccurate**
A: Investigation quality depends on:
- Issue description quality (be specific!)
- Codebase accessibility
- Reproduction steps (if known)
Try providing more context and re-investigate.
