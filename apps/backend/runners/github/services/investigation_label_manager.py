"""
Investigation Label Manager
============================

Manages GitHub lifecycle labels for issue investigations.
Labels are synced one-way (app -> GitHub) with graceful error handling
so label failures never crash the investigation pipeline.

Includes debounce logic (5s) on set_investigation_label() to avoid
rapid-fire GitHub API calls during fast state transitions.

Debounce implementation:
- Non-terminal states are debounced within a 5-second window
- Terminal states (findings_ready, task_created, done) bypass debounce
- Pending state is tracked and applied on the next non-debounced call
