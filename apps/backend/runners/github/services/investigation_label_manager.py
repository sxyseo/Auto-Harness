"""
Investigation Label Manager
============================

Manages GitHub lifecycle labels for issue investigations.
Labels are synced one-way (app -> GitHub) with graceful error handling
so label failures never crash the investigation pipeline.

Includes debounce logic (5s) on set_investigation_label() to avoid
rapid-fire GitHub API calls during fast state transitions.
